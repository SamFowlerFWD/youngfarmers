## 🔄 Version 3.0 - Simplified Approach

**What Changed:**
- ❌ **Removed**: Complex revenue features NOT requested in RFQ (marketplace, courses, partnerships)
- ✅ **Added**: Low-hanging fruit features (event booking, directory, newsletter, resources, competitions)
- ✅ **Added**: Demo build guide (QUICK-START-DEMO.md and 00-DEMO-PROJECT-README.md)
- ✅ **Added**: RFQ alignment analysis (21-RFQ-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md)
- 💰 **Reduced**: Realistic budget £40-65K (was £58-78K)
- 🎯 **Focused**: On serving members, not generating revenue

**Key Realization:**
The original documentation assumed complex integrations and revenue generation features that were never requested. Version 3.0 focuses on exactly what the RFQ asks for, plus simple valuable additions.

**Recommended Path:**
1. Read `QUICK-START-DEMO.md` for immediate action
2. Review `21-RFQ-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md` for understanding
3. Build demo using `00-DEMO-PROJECT-README.md`
4. Clarify Silo integration requirements with client
5. Use agent prompts (09-15) for specific features if needed
